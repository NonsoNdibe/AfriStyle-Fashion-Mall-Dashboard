# AfriStyle Fashion Mall Sales Performance Dashboard Project

## Business Overview/Problem
 AfriStyle relies heavily on its weekly sales performance to gauge market traction and devise future
 strategies. However, the Regional Sales Manager of AfriStyle, Nigerian division, has been facing
 challenges in obtaining a clear and efficient view of these sales figures. 
 The manager has identified the
 need for an organized and efficient way to monitor weekly sales performance. Current method involves
 manually computing sales, a process that is time-consuming, prone to inaccuracies, and lacks visual
 representation, making it difficult to see trends.

 trends.
 
 B.

 possible inaccuracies.
 
 C.
